Let's get back into the swing of writing and running C#, and also practice using lists.

Make sure to write/run this code in your local Visual Studio instead of using an online environment,
so you get used to doing that again!

You can follow along with this official multi-step C# tutorial in two ways:
1. (Easier) Start at the end and type in/run a [completed program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/list-collection?tutorial-step=6)
as practice. This will allow you to practice the kata as we usually do in class - to sharpen your muscle memory of typing C#,
and not to ask you to think about the problem yourself.
1. (Harder) Start [from the beginning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/list-collection)
to practice some skills and then try to use them on your own. This will take you on more of a learning journey,
with an answer presented at the end.
